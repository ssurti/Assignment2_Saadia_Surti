ASSIGNMENT # 2 
CIT/CSE 337 
DUE DATE: Sept 30th, 2016
In this assignment, you demonstrate your understanding of and ability to use GIT for managing your project codebase. Create a remote repository on the same machine for managing your master/origin and other branch. (Students may choose their implementation language other the JAVA). 

Ask class TA for coding help, if you cannot implement required function. 

Steps to perform (This is a guideline. They may not map in your exact workflow): 
1. Create a new folder for this assignment.
2. Initialize git for version control of this assignment artifact. 
3. Create new file called README. Populate its content with description of the goal of this project.
4. Add this file in version control. 
5. Commit the changes with proper comment. 
6. Create remote repository and push existing content in it. 
7. Create a working branch with your user name. 
8. Check out your named branch just created. 
9. Create a new file in this folder called BeerSong.java 
10. Add empty Main() and Ninety_Nine_Bottles_of_Beer() functions that performs following task.
========================== Program Specification========================== 
Main function calls Ninety_Nine_Bottles_of_Beer() Function to print the “99 Bottles of Beer” song. Through this exercise, you will enhance your java programing skills further including GIT version control and problem solving. Assume that your console is a wall where the song will be written once your code compiles and executes. 
****************************** **Program output***** *************************** 99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer take one down, pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall. 98 bottles of beer on the wall, 98 bottles of beer take one down, pass it around, 97 bottles of beer on the wall. 97 bottles of beer on the wall, 97 bottles of beer take one down, pass it around, 96 bottles of beer on the wall. ... 2 bottles of beer on the wall, 2 bottles of beer take one down, pass it around, 1 bottle of beer on the wall. 1 bottle of beer on the wall, 1 bottle of beer take one down, pass it around, no more bottles of beer on the wall. 
***************************** End program output ******************************* 11. Add the file to repository and commit it with comments. 
12. Push the content to remote repository. 
13. Create and checkout new branch called “implementation”
14. Implement each method in this branch and ensure that there is no programming error pertaining to code in each method. 
15. For every method implemented, you must commit those changes with appropriate comment in working repository as well as remote repository. 
16. Push all commits and content to remote repository. 
17. Print the log of all the changes you have made during entire development cycle of this assignment. Print it out and submit its hard copy with your source code by due date.

GOAL: 
Your repository must have two branches. One containing the stubbed version of the functions while the other containing implementation. You must also show ability to merge these branches to master branch for releasing the code. You must commit your code as frequently as possible. Each commit must include appropriate comment about code changes that you are pushing.
